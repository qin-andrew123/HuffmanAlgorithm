This compresses a text file using the Huffman algorithm. Prior to running the executable, you must first create a text file that you want to compress. For instance, a <text.txt> file which contains some amount of text. 
Then you can run the executable. It will ask you if you want to compress <comp> or decompress <decomp> and you input what option you want to do. Next you will input the file name that you wish the algorithm to run on. 
Finally you will input the name of the compressed output or decompressed output.
